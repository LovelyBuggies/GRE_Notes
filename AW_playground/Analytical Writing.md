# Analytical Writing

## Argument

对于除了Explanation以外的direction，读题目的时候思考constricted facts——就是原facts加上新的facts就不成立了；架构是some assumptions based on some evidences。对于Explanation的direction，读题目的时候思考其他的解释，架构是some explaination due to the facts。

### Unwarranted Assumption

首段+段间关系是从facts到assumptions的几个推导过程存在问题+从assumptions推导到claim有问题+收尾段。

#### 首段写法

- 作者的预测了…提议了...；
  - In the letter, the writer recommend an initiation of …
- 尽管从一些角度来看提议是beneficial 的，但是reasoning is unconvincing由于一些未被证明的assumption，如果证明是不合理的，将会severely undermine 作者的提议；
  - While this program might be beneficial to some extent, the reasoning of this argument is unconvincing due to several unsubstantiated assumptions which, if proven unwarranted, will seriously challenge the author's recommendation.

#### 段间写法

- 作者依赖的assumption是什么；
  - relies heavily on the assumption that, based on which, the author therefore propose that —— 联系claim层和assumption层；
  - by stating (facts) rules out the possibility that —— 联系facts 层和assumption层；
  - even if the assumptions mentioned above are valid, the writer's recommendation could be unnecessary due to the doubtful assumption that …—— 适用于最后一段列举一大堆不合理的assumptions
- 如果CFs（constrained facts）存在，assumption就会不成立
  - assumption is problematic because we are not informed that/nor do we know/we even have no idea that
  - we need to re-examine the assumption that … It's likely that/it's of equal possibility that ...
  - it's unreasonable to assume that …/the author hastily comes to the conclusion that  
- claim 被严重削弱
  - argument is unconvincing 
  - therefore, s.b. might not ….

#### 收尾段写法

- 我们是否应该实现作者的建议很大程度取决于assumption的有效性；
  - To summarize, whether or not we should implement the writer's recommendation depends greatly  on the validity of the assumption in the argument.
- 如果假设不是合理的，那结果可能偏离作者的初衷，因此我们要思考其他解决方案。
  - If these assumptions prove unwarranted, then the recommendation will be little more than the writer's wishful thinking, and accordingly we need to consider other solutions to the … problem.

### Specific Evidence

首段+段间关系是从facts到assumptions的几个推导过程中的CFs是什么、影响+从assumptions推导到claim CFs+收尾段。**注意，这个不能使用评价性的词语如wrong/unconvincing/flawed。**

#### 首段写法

In the application, the author requests that … To support his conclusion, he points out that … Moreover, he uses a series of evidence to demonstrate the … In addition, a study is cited … Although … may be lucrative, close scrutiny reveals that the conclusion lacts critical support, and therefore we need more evidence to help evaluate the argument.
