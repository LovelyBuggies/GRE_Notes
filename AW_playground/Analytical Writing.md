# Analytical Writing

## Argument

> 对于除了Explanation以外的direction，**读题目的时候思考constricted facts**——就是原facts加上新的facts就不成立了；架构是some assumptions based on some facts。对于Explanation的direction，**读题目的时候思考其他的解释**，架构是some explaination due to the facts。一般都会用while/although加一个小让步，这个**让步存在于首段和末尾段**，**以及最后一个**从assumption到claim的**中间段开头**。

### Unwarranted Assumption

首段+段间关系是从facts到assumptions的几个推导过程存在问题+从assumptions推导到claim有问题+收尾段。

#### 首段写法

- 作者的预测了…提议了...；
  - In the letter, the writer recommend an initiation of …
- 尽管从一些角度来看提议是beneficial 的，但是reasoning is unconvincing由于一些未被证明的assumption，如果证明是不合理的，将会severely undermine 作者的提议。
  - While this program might be beneficial to some extent, the reasoning of this argument is unconvincing due to several unsubstantiated assumptions which, if proven unwarranted, will seriously challenge the author's recommendation.

#### 中间段写法

- 作者依赖的assumption是什么；
  - Relies heavily on the assumption that ..., based on which, the author therefore propose that … —— 联系claim层和assumption层；
  - By stating (facts) rules out the possibility that … —— 联系facts 层和assumption层；
  - Even if the assumptions mentioned above are valid, the writer's recommendation could be unnecessary due to the doubtful/dubitable assumption that … —— 适用于最后一段列举一大堆不合理的assumptions
- 如果CFs（constrained facts）存在，assumption就会不成立；
  - Assumption is problematic because we are not informed that/nor do we know/we even have no idea that
  - We need to re-examine the assumption that … It's likely that/it's of equal possibility that ...
  - It's unreasonable to assume that …/the author hastily comes to the conclusion that  
- claim 被严重削弱。
  - Argument is unconvincing 
  - Therefore, s.b. might not ….

#### 收尾段写法

- 我们是否应该实现作者的建议很大程度取决于assumption的有效性；
  - To summarize, whether or not we should implement the writer's recommendation depends greatly  on the validity of the assumption in the argument.
- 如果假设不是合理的，那结果可能偏离作者的初衷，因此我们要思考其他解决方案。
  - If these assumptions prove unwarranted, then the recommendation will be little more than the writer's wishful thinking, and accordingly we need to consider other solutions to the … problem.

### Specific Evidence

首段+段间关系是从facts到assumptions的几个推导过程中的CFs是什么、影响+从assumptions推导到claim CFs+收尾段。**注意，这个不能使用评价性的词语如wrong/unconvincing/flawed。**

#### 首段写法

- 作者提议...
  - In the application, the author requests that … 
- 为了支持他的提议，他列举了一系列evidence
  - To support his conclusion, he points out that … Moreover, he uses a series of evidence to demonstrate the … In addition, a study is cited …
- 尽管可能会不错，但是缺乏关键的证据支持，我们需要更多证据去帮助评估这个argument
  - Although … may be lucrative, close scrutiny reveals that the conclusion lacts critical support, and therefore we need more evidence to help evaluate the argument.

#### 中间段写法

- 我们现在还无法判断某一个assumption
  - First of all/Secondly, we need more evidence to ascertain/verify whether ...
  - Finally, despite the presence of all the previous evidence, an accurate evaluation of the developers' request requires additional information. Specific evidence is needed to show … 
- 我们需要判断other CFs（evidence）来determine assumptions 是否成立
  - While the author shows that … , no evidence serves to rule out the possibility that … Specifically/for example, … —— 单个CF
  - First, although …, …; Second, we need to know the reason why/whether …; Third, the evaluation of the statement concerning … not only …, but also … —— 多CF
  -  …; that is to say/in other words, whether … if the answer is positive; or else, the …
- 这些CFs undermine/support the claim
  - If new evidence shows that …, then it's reasonably safe to claim that …, and therefore the author's recommendation is weakened/supported. However, if new evidence discloses an opposite situation, the the proposal in the argument is lent great support to/is greatly undermined
  - If …, then ...

#### 收尾段写法

- 没有提供足够的证据（*这里并没有评价性的词语评价这个argument*）
  - To sum up, the evidence cited by the developers does not provide enough conclusive information to make their request convincing.
- 需要其他证据来加强
  - As a result, we need additional evidence to better evaluation the argument/bolster it.

### Requiring Questions 

首段+段间关系是从facts到assumptions的几个推导过程中的问题是什么、答案影响+从assumptions推导到claim CFs+收尾段。**这个和evidence类很像就是把CFs换成了问题**。

#### 首段写法

- 作者的提议
  - In the letter, the author predicts that ...
- 尽管可能合理，但是取决于以下问题
  - While … might be desirable, whether the preciton is reasonable hinges on the answers to the following questions.

### 中间段写法

- 我们还没法判断某一论断/我们需要判断…/我提出的问题围绕着...论断
  - The first series of questions I am going to put forward revolve around …
  - Witnessing …, the author further proposes … However, before reaching that conclusion, we need to know …
- CFs决定的问题
  - More specifically, I need to ask ...
  - It's still a quesition whether ...
  - … might, therefore we need to ask ...
  - … is an unaswered question. Simply speaking, ...
- 问题答案对argument的影响
  - If the answer to the question is positive/yes, …/the argument's prediction is undermined/shored up/reasonable/supposed to be rejected/encouraged. On the contrary, if it turns out to be other way around/Otherwise/In other circumstances/but if, then ...

### 收尾段写法

- 我们是否应该采取策略应该被更多考虑
  - While I sympathize with the author's intention to …, whether we should … is subject to more consideration.
- 我们应该知道这些问题的答案
  - We especially need to know ...

### Alternative Explanation

首段+段间关系是facts的reasoning+从reasoning推导到explanation+收尾段。

#### 首段写法

- 我们知道的facts
  - In this argument, we are informed that ...
- 尽管我承认…但我认为还有其他解释
  - While I concede that …, I maintain that the other plausible explanations can also account for the facts presented in this argument. 
- 我们无法判断这个解释是不是最好的或者自己就能导致这一切
  - Howeve, with only the the current information, we are unable to decide which explanation is best. Nor is it utterly certain that one factor alone is responsible for the facts presented in the argument.

#### 中间段写法

  - To begin with, the author claims that … due to ...
  - The author ascribes … to ...
  - Even if … is indeed …, it is doubtful that … is the only factor responsible.

  - It would be unfair to keep blind to the possible scenarios wherein ...
  - … could also be explained by ...
  - … may stem from a variety of factors: ...
- 提出挑战/我们不确定
  - All of the aforementioned explanations pose a great challenge upon, if not utterly reverse, the proposed one in the arguement.
  - If this is the case, the … is less responsible for …, since ...
  - We are not confident that these explanations could rival the one proposed in the argument.

#### 收尾段写法

- 尽管理性认为…导致…，还有其他原因
  - To summarize, although it is reasonable to believe that …, there several alternative explanations that could plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.
- 在搞清楚…之前作出的reasoning是hasty的
  - Thus, it is unreasonable to draw hasty conclusions about … until further examination.
