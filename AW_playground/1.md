In the memo the vice president of Nature's Way (NW), a chain of stores selling health food and other health-related products, recommends opening a store in Plainesiville. To support this recommendation, the vice presidents cites the following facts about Plainesville: (1) sales of exercise shoes and clothing are at all-time highs; (2) the local health club is more popular than ever; and (3) the city's schoolchildren are required to participate in a fitness program. Close scrutiny of these facts, however, reveals that none of them lend credible support to the recommendation.



First, strong sales of exercise apparel do not neccessarily indicate that Plainesville residents would be interested in NW's products. or that these residents are interested in exercising. Perhaps, exercise apparel happends to be fashionable at the monent, or inexpensive compared to other types of clothing. For that matter, perhaps the stronger-than-usual sales are due to increasing sales to tourists. In short, without ruling out other possible reasons for the strong sales, the Vice President cannot convince me on the basis of them that Plainesville residents are exercising regularly. let alone that they would be interested in buying the sort of food and other products that NW sells.



Secondly, even if exercise is more popular among Plainesville residents than ever before, the vice president assumes further that people who exercise regularly are also interested in buying health food and health-related products. Yet the memo contins no evidence to support this assumption. Lacking such evidence it is equally possible that aside from exercising Plainesivlle residents have little interest in leading a healthy lifestyle. In fact, perhaps as a result of regular exercise they believe they are sufficiently fit and healthy and do no need a healthy diet.



Thirdly, the popularity of the local health club is little indication that NW will earn a profit from a store in Plainesville. Perhaps club members live in an area of Plainesville nowhere near feasible sites for a NW store. Or perhaps the clubs primary appeal is as a singles meeting place, and that members actually have little interest in a healthy lifestyle. Besides, even if the club's members would patronize a NW store these members might be insufficient in number to ensure a profit for the store, especially considering that this health club is the only one in Plainesville.
