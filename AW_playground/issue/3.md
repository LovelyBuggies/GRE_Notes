The speaker asserts that the government are supposed to give prior financial support to major cities rather, for the county's cultural tradition is mostly generated and preserved in these major cities. It's seems to be tempting to agree with the speaker on the basis for the essential status on which these major cities stand. However, I think the speaker does not look at this issue dynamically and overlooks some external factors.



The implicit rationale behind the speaker's statement seems to be that many large cities are the center of politic and economic, thus they definitely deserve larger finiancial support to show the propserity of the country as well as the culture. Adimittedly, many metropolis always severs to be the capital, and it needs more funds to capture the most typical features of the epic. However, that does not mean that the government should provide unlimited financial support for them. If this happened, superfluous aids might induce many problems, such as the venal bureaucracy, the low-efficiency usage of money, and so no. In this situation, allocating a bit of money for the development of other less perspicuous cities and their traditons would definitely be a better use.



It's might also be tempting to back on the speaker when it comes to the majority theory. After all, biger cities tend to have the larger population, and people are often the carriers of the local traditions. However, majority is not enough. In fact, some unique cultural traditions are carried by the minority. And therefore, the government has the mission to perserve as many as artforms, in order to keep the diversity of the culture of the nation.



Besides, I would like to discuss several external factors which may have effects on this topic. The first argument aganist the speaker's opinion is that all traditions is not unchangable, so the sites of tradition are not stable, either. In the epic of globalizaiton, modern means of transportation narrow the distance between us, thus, the traditional activities can be diverted from their origins. We have often seen the modification or enhancement of traditions in some other areas. From this perspective, we need to look at the events from a dialectical eye. Additionally, I doubt the support on traditions only in a pecuniary manner. Sometimes, tranditions need particular cares rather than just money. Under such circumstances, it will bring a better outcome for the government to make some disseminations for these treasures.



In the final analysis, the speaker claims that majoy cities deserve more fininal support for the good of the cultural traditions. It's seems to be true as they are the center of country, however, after scrutinizing this statement, I find it suffers limitations in the scale of time and support them only by money is not enough.
