In the article, the speaker asserts that the educational institutions should hinder their students from learning something that they have few chances to succeed. It's might be tempting to agree with the speaker on the basis that the success has always been a human pursuit. However, I think the speaker subjectively overlooks the development of indispensable hobbies, the necessary need for relaxation, as well as the limitation of the institutions' ability.



The implict rationale behind the speaker's statement seems to be the appeal to save time, money, and stamina. Since our resource is always limited, it's impossible for students to overarching all things. Under such circumstances, we need to make sacrifice for the overall betterment. Students today are always occupied with their studies, that's why they simply do not have time for other after-class activities. If they allocated much time on these activities, they would definitely suffer a loss of time in their studies. So that's why many parents and teachers nowadays do not recommended them to take part in so many clubs. Simply, if we put too much efforts on something we are not likely to achieve, we are wasting our resource to some extent.



Although the point the speaker makes seems to be convincing, it still have some essential blemishes. On the other hand are two compelling arguments that against the speakers position. The first one is the target of developing hobbies, which would generate many unexpected by-products. Take myself as an example. I have engaged myself in gym for a long time, not because I think I can be some inflencers of this area, instead, what I want is just to keep fit. After some weight training and cardiovascular training, I feel refreshed. Although I am still a newer in this area and do not achieve much success, I find myself robuster and healthier, which is all I expect.



The other position comes to the way of relaxation. Nowadays, more and more people live busy lives and try to escape from taxing work. In this situation, pursuing fields for success is not an appropriate choice anymore. We pick up books to broaden our horizons; we design a scheme just for fan; and we play music only for appreciation. These activities hardly have somethings to do with making some progresses, no to mention success. Who said a physist cannot play violin like Enstein did? Educational institutions should definitely not prohibit their students to have such advantageous relaxation.



Besides, the third argument against the speakers statement has to be the ability of these institution. I doubt whether they have the ability to intervene their students daily lives. Since most students spend their nights at home, schools do not have the access to supervise their students to study fields related to success. Without the capability as the bedrock of responsibility, I don't think the speak's statement is practical as it stands.



In the final analysis, the speaker believe that the educational institutions should prohibit their students to do something which seem to be unmeaningful. However, as far as I am concerned, I think he underestimates the underlying and profound effects, which might do good to the students development. In the meantime, without the sufficient ability to supervise the students all the time, it's useless to discuss their responsibility.
