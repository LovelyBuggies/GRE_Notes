Whether the students in a country need to take the same curriculum before they enter college? Some people believe that they do not need to follow the same curriculum for everyone has his specialty. However, as far as I am concerned, I believe student need to take the same courses in some circumstances.

Students could take different elementary courses to develop their interests in specifical areas. As these classes are primaryly aimed to form a rudimentary understanding for them when choosing their majors in college, students should be allowed to make a choice while taking such courses. For example, the eduation system in my country provides several kinds of courses, such physical, chemistry, biology, history, and so on. Moreover, students can also participate in different clubs in my high school for after-class learning. In this situation, a limitation on such choices will definitely come to be as a manacle for them.

Although students should be offered freedom when making some of their choices, they should also follow some restrains in some circumstances. When the cirriculum has some thing to do with the national culture or classical value, I think students are expected to take them in this circumstance. Students are required to learn these courses for the following reasons. First, these courses can help to develop a common sense of feeling by providing basic idea of their nation or religion. For example, by reading Bibe together, students are more able to be understable to the traumatic experience of Christan. By perusing the novels written by Xun Lu, we are able to see the living environment of old China. In this circumstances, this cirriculum is beneficial for every student.

Beside, another situation that student are required to learn some thing in common comes when the cirriculum related to fundamental principles. As this principles or knowledge are of primary importance in their future life, it's obvious that they should have some basical understanding of them until enter college. Learning basic ideas like computing formula in math gives them the ability to solve puzzles; knowing ideas like gravity in physics elucadites "why apples fell from tree". These knowlege are so fundamental that they need to know, in these circumstances.

To sum up, it's true that everyone has limit times and we can not learn everything. But we still need to have some understanding when it comes to national culture and basic knowledge.
