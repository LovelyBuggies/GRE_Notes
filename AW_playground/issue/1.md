The speaker considers practicality as an idol, which all power and talents should serve, and we should terminate all activities which have no practicle uses. It might be tempting to agree with the speaker on the basis that using our intelligence to create tangible value has always been the human desire, and there are limit amount of resource on our planet so we need to make good use of it. However, the speaker overlooks the necessarily trials and errors and the effort for the aesthetic use.



As I see it, there are two fundamental arguments for supporting the speaker's opinion. One of the implicit rationale behind the speaker's statement seems to be that in most cases, the practicality seems to be the intent or the final goal of our measurements. Normally, the practicality shows the direction to help us become more productivity. The governments levy the tax for the betterment of our life quality; the medical organization use their finiancial aids to save more lives; the universities spend money on education quality improvement. No one would be willing to squander money and patronize an aimless projecting or something fantasy, since most people will consider this as hysteria. 



The second position comes to the using efficiency of resource. After all, it's our nature to save efforts from useless things for better need, and the practical usage is almost the only persuasive point.  I don't believe that the government would likely to persistently support a scientific research, after seeing no achievements for so many years, or the United Bank would like to give continuous loan to the unrealistic dreamers. This is definitely impossible! Because endless failures always cause the trust issue, and as a result, the cooperation no longer exists.



Although what the speaker says seems to be convincing in many situations, there still exists many circumstances where this statement is not accurate. On the other hand are two arguments against his viewpoint. One such argument has to be the vague definition of practicality, upon the indeterminate outcome of activities and the domain of practicality. We usually not informed the usability of a new product before we finish the whole process. Defective goods is always generated as byproduct of the success. In this case, we can not simply determine them as useless, for "the failure is the mother of success". Have you ever heared the famous anecdote of Edison that he invented the light bulbs by many trials and errors? Under many circumstances, the achievements do not come with efforts synchronously.



The othe argument is the domain of usability. In this issue, the speaker does not offer the domain of practicality. We are not informed whether the reffered "practicality" includes some intangible value such as the aesthetic value, the future potential, and so on. If the speaker broadened the domain of practicality to this scale, I think the answer would be doubtless. We should definitely give support to the valued activities which are beneficial to the country solidarity and the civilian's mental health, although they may seemed to be useless. The judgement of practicality ususally is determined in which viewpoint we see it, so it's equivocal as it stands.



In sum, the speaker asserts that things are low-valued if they have not practicle use. I agree that we need to allocate resource on what is clearly useful and urgent. Yet, it's just likely we underestimate the value of something for we do not realize its shining points. Thus, this issue is somehow arbitrary, and we should look things with a dialectical eyes.
